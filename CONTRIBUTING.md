- biggest contribution is to actually use the package, implementing testcases, findings bugs or
parts that are tedious to use
- adapt Frontend of report files (implemented in `simple_system_tests/ReportHtml.py`), eg. how log
content is displayed or basically CSS
- what kind of functionality should be added / changed to the framework, create an issue for that
- when changing something in the repository, create a separate branch with a suitable name, make
a Pull Request when finished
